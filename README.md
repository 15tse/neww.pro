A softwer developer's daily activities can vary widely based on the project they are working on, their role within the team, and the stage of development the project is in. However, a typical day often involves several common interactions with Git, a distributed version control system that helps developers manage changes to source code and collaborate with others. Below is a step-by-step guide to a developer's daily activities involving Git, assuming the developer is contributing to a project with an established codebase.

1. Start the Day by Syncing Your Code
a. Fetch Changes from the Remote Repository

git fetch origin

This command downloads new data from the remote repository without integrating any of these changes into your local branches.

b. Merge Updates into Your Local Main Branch

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Switch to the main branch and merge any changes from the remote main branch into your local main branch. This ensures you're working with the most up-to-date version of the codebase.

2. Create a New Branch for Today's Work

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Create and switch to a new branch where you'll make all your changes. This keeps your work isolated from the main codebase until it's ready to be reviewed and merged.

3. Do Your Work
a. Make Changes in Your Code Editor
This step involves the actual coding work, debugging, and local testing.

b. Stage Your Changes


git add .

This command stages all your changes for commit. You can also stage files individually.

c. Commit Your Changes Locally

git commit -m "A descriptive message about your changes"

Commit your staged changes along with a descriptive message explaining what you've done.

4. Sync Your Work with the Remote Repository
a. Fetch and Merge Changes Again
Before you share your work, it's a good idea to make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge main
This sequence ensures your feature branch has the latest updates from the main branch.

b. Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository


git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Push your local branch to the remote repository. This makes it available to other team members.

5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Use the project's hosting service (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to open a new pull request. This signals to your team that your code is ready for review.

6. Review and Collaborate
a. Review Comments
Your teammates will review your code and may suggest changes.

b. Make Necessary Changes Locally
If you need to make changes based on feedback, simply repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary.

c. Update the PR
After pushing updates, notify your team. Your PR will automatically update with the new commits.

7. Merge Your PR
Once your PR is approved, you or a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch. This often involves ensuring your branch has no conflicts with the main branch and possibly squashing your commits into a single commit for a cleaner history.

8. Clean Up
After your branch is merged, you can delete your local and remote feature branches if they're no longer needed.

Local:

git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
